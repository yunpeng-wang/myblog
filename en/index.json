Three years have passed since, and this was my first time birding in China. Finally, I was here.\nI\u0026rsquo;d read on eBird that China ranks among the countries with the most recorded bird species, so I came with high expectations — along with a few doubts. Urbanization here, especially in cities like Shenzhen, is intense. Would the ecology still hold up?\nTurned out my worries were unnecessary.\nMy first stop was Talent Park, where you can look out over Shenzhen Bay and see Hong Kong on the far shore. The weather was relatively cool but muggy — several days of rain had left the air heavy.\nI was lucky to spot a crowd gathered by the lake, all staring toward a rocky patch in the middle of the water. There\u0026rsquo;s always something reassuring about seeing others with the same purpose. Someone told me they were hoping to catch a glimpse of a rare wader with red legs. But to me, everything on that little beach was rare. I took plenty of photos and video. The only pity? The birds barely moved — perhaps it was the heavy air.\nThe photo below features the Pacific Golden Plover and the Tibetan Sand Plover.\nBut they weren\u0026rsquo;t my main goal today. I was here for the Red-whiskered Bulbul — a tropical bird with striking red patches on its cheeks and undertail. There\u0026rsquo;s a well-known photo composition that gets shared online: a bulbul holding a red berry in its beak, perfectly echoing its red feathers. Mother Nature\u0026rsquo;s design at its finest.\nAnd today, I got lucky.\nAt the edge where a bush met a grove, I found a small flock of Red-whiskered Bulbuls and Light-vented Bulbuls, foraging among fallen berries. I even managed to capture the classic moment — though the berries were black this time.\nHonestly, Shenzhen\u0026rsquo;s natural environment surprised me. Bird life here is rich, and the birds are far less wary of humans than I expected. If you stand still, some may approach within two meters. It feels like nature is willing to let you in — as if you belong.\nAnd so this marks the quiet end of my first blog post… with a portrait of a charming Oriental Magpie-Robin.
