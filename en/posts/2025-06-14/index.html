  "articleBody": " 2025.06.14｜Tokyo, Japan\nIt’s been a while since my last post. I’ve spent most of my weekends diving into web development and building my newborn site.\nTo my surprise, I found it deeply captivating. I began to understand why web development has become so compelling over the past decade. Unlike most programming, which functions as a mathematical tool, front-end development appears more akin to a painter’s brush or a sculptor’s chisel. Every line of code transforms into color, shape, or motion. A great website isn’t just technical — it’s conceptual. It becomes a mirror of your identity in the digital realm — or, if you’ll permit the outdated term, the “metaverse”.\nAlright, without further ado. This is still a wild post.\nThis time, I headed to Tokyo Port Wild Bird Park, a site tucked into the Tokyo Bay near the estuary of the Tama River. You’ll find plenty of anglers lining the banks there, luring and fly fishing in the wide tidal channels. Ironically, this bird park isn’t that “wild”. It’s well-developed, with a spacious visitor center staffed by members of the Wild Bird Society of Japan, who update the daily sightings board and provide public field scopes for use.\nNaturally, the park features multiple bird hides. The good news? You get a seat, a table for stability, and a roof over your head when the weather turns foul. The downside? The narrow viewing slits can severely limit your shooting angles. It’s the reason I used to frequent this park in my first year of birding, but now come back only occasionally.\nToday’s visit was sparked by a recent eBird report of Common Terns seen in the area. Yes, I still hadn’t given up on my Tern Quest.\nThe weather was cloudy with intermittent rain. The park was nearly overrun by White-cheeked Starlings, whose sharp calls echoed constantly through the trees — louder even than the planes roaring overhead from nearby Haneda Airport.\nAt the visitor center, a large glass curtain wall offered a glimpse of the pond and tidelands – a few Great Cormorants stood sentinel on pond stakes, while a lone Little Grebe bobbed in and out of the water.\nI then made my rounds to three different hides. All I found were two Little Ringed Plovers, busy foraging in a patch of reeds that had been cut down to stubs, now carpeted in dark green moss. Watching the Plovers dart among them, evoked images of 70 million years ago, small theropods zigzagging through primeval forests.\nThe English name highlights their black neckband, but I personally prefer the poetic Chinese name, literally “Golden Orbit Plover”, a nod to their vivid yellow eye-ring.\nI was beginning to accept that these might be the only harvest today – until a black flash streaked across my field of view. A Barn Swallow had arrived, darting through the open air like a missile.\nIt flew swiftly, shuttling back and forth in front of the viewing slit. I thrust my lens through the opening and locked on using the red-dot sight. Photographing Swallows is always equal parts pain and pleasure – their acrobatic maneuvers make autofocus almost pointless, but reviewing the burst shots later is like unwrapping lottery tickets – you never know which shot will hit the jackpot.\nI lingered into the dusk, but there were still no signs of Terns.\nJust as I was packing up inside the visitor center, a staff member approached and pointed out an Osprey perched on a tree across the pond – roughly 160 meters away, according to Google Maps.\nIt was already drizzling, with the kind of low, blue-gray light that photographers dread. The image was foggy and lacked contrast. Still, a raptor is always worth the moment. You don’t leave before bowing to the king of the sky. ",

<p><em><strong>2025.06.14｜Tokyo, Japan</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>It’s been a while since my last post. I’ve spent most of my weekends diving into web development and building my newborn site.</p>
<p>To my surprise, I found it deeply captivating. I began to understand why web development has become so compelling over the past decade. Unlike most programming, which functions as a mathematical tool, front-end development appears more akin to a painter’s brush or a sculptor’s chisel. Every line of code transforms into color, shape, or motion. A great website isn’t just technical — it’s conceptual. It becomes a mirror of your identity in the digital realm — or, if you’ll permit the outdated term, the “metaverse”.</p>
<p>Alright, without further ado. This is still a wild post.</p>
<p>This time, I headed to Tokyo Port Wild Bird Park, a site tucked into the Tokyo Bay near the estuary of the Tama River. You’ll find plenty of anglers lining the banks there, luring and fly fishing in the wide tidal channels.

<p>Ironically, this bird park isn’t that “wild”. It’s well-developed, with a spacious visitor center staffed by members of the Wild Bird Society of Japan, who update the daily sightings board and provide public field scopes for use.</p>
<p>Naturally, the park features multiple bird hides. The good news? You get a seat, a table for stability, and a roof over your head when the weather turns foul. The downside?

<p>I was beginning to accept that these might be the only harvest today – until a black flash streaked across my field of view. A <strong>Barn Swallow</strong> had arrived, darting through the open air like a missile.</p>
<p>It flew swiftly, shuttling back and forth in front of the viewing slit. I thrust my lens through the opening and locked on using the red-dot sight. Photographing <strong>Swallows</strong> is always equal parts pain and pleasure – their acrobatic maneuvers make autofocus almost pointless, but reviewing the burst shots later is like unwrapping lottery tickets – you never know which shot will hit the jackpot.</p>

<p>I lingered into the dusk, but there were still no signs of <strong>Terns</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as I was packing up inside the visitor center, a staff member approached and pointed out an <strong>Osprey</strong> perched on a tree across the pond – roughly 160 meters away, according to Google Maps.</p>
<p>It was already drizzling, with the kind of low, blue-gray light that photographers dread. The image was foggy and lacked contrast. Still, a raptor is always worth the moment. You don’t leave before bowing to the king of the sky.
